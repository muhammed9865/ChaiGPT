# ChaiGPT
ChaiGPT is a ChatBot (WoW new idea!!!). The reason of creating this project is to use the latest tools in Android like Jetpack Compose and Koin. Also trying out a new tool for a backend-less service instead of Firebase called Back4App.

## Current used tools
- Jetpack Compose (UI toolkit)
- Koin (DI tool in Kotlin)
- Retrofit (Will migrate to Ktor client)
- Proto DataStore (Instead of Shared preferences or Preferences DataStore)
- Startup (Initializer library to initialize SDKs during launch time)

## Figma design
Trying to make a design for the app, if you can contribute in designing it as well, that would be appreciated a lot
